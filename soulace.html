          <h3>Problem</h3>
          <p>
            After a loss, people face emotional and practical challenges. Users
            need a way to find trusted resources to manage funeral planning,
            legal matters, and other related tasks, as grief combined with
            urgent responsibilities makes it difficult to locate and coordinate
            the necessary services and support.
          </p>
          <p>
            Success Metrics: Faster service coordination, improved task
            completion, and positive feedback showing users feel supported and
            find value in the app.
          </p>
          <h3>Solution</h3>
          <p>
            We propose a user-friendly app offering personalized bereavement
            support with local service directories, educational resources, 24/7
            support, family coordination tools and secured document management.

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>
              The interviews and surveys strongly confirmed the widespread need
              for support in this area. Loss is a universal experience and while
              everyone's emotional journey differs, the practical challenges
              remain consistent, from funeral planning to legal and estate
              matters.

            How might we create an app that eases the burdens of bereavement,
            reduces stress, and provides practical tools to help users manage
            their responsibilities while offering comfort and support during
            this difficult time?

              <h3>Conclusion</h3>
              <p>
                The card sort workshop yielded surprising results that
                challenged my initial assumptions. Before conducting it with
                participants, I had carefully prepared by running a self-test,
                refining the card set from 40 to 30 items, and simplifying the
                wording. I chose a hybrid card sort approach, providing
                predefined categories while allowing participants to create
                their own if needed.
              </p>
              <p>
                The results revealed unexpected patterns. One participant
                created a "Dedicated Chat Space" category for the "Chat" card,
                while another made a separate "Task Delegation" category due to
                unfamiliarity with the term. Many cards proved more versatile
                than anticipated, fitting logically into multiple categories.
                For example, the "Favorited Collections of places, articles,
                etc." card was frequently placed under "My Profile," though I
                had intended it for the "Home Dashboard" to ensure easy access.
              </p>
              <p>
                The "My Profile" cards presented another interesting case. While
                I expected the "My__" prefix to clearly signal their category,
                the results varied significantly between groups. In the first
                group, 8 of 14 participants categorized them as intended, but in
                the second group, 6 of 14 participants placed them elsewhere.
              </p>
              <p>
                This experience has led me to consider running an open card sort
                in the future. Though I initially chose to provide categories to
                guide participants, given the unique nature of my app concept,
                the results demonstrated that even careful preparation can't
                prevent our assumptions from being challenged.

              Goal: Assess user interactions with Soulace, identify pain points,
              and gather feedback to refine its design. We aim to ensure the app
              is intuitive and supportive, focusing on seamless service
              searches, resource access, and account creation.

            <ol>
              <li>
                Analyze the ease of account creation and setup, ensuring the
                process feels straightforward and welcoming.
              </li>
              <li>
                Determine how efficiently users can find and access local
                services, such as funeral homes, legal offices and support
                organizations.
              </li>
              <li>
                Assess how easily users can navigate core features, such as
                adding a new task, schedule an event and upload documents to the
                vaults.
              </li>
              <li>
                Collect feedback on design, functionality and the overall
                impressions to align the apps experience with user needs during
                challenging times.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Methodology: The study will be conducted as moderated remote
              tests. Sessions will be 30 minutes. Test will start off with a
              brief introduction, a moment to gain rapport, task instructions
              and performance with Soulace conducted on a mobile prototype
              through Figma and a debriefing.

            <h3>Usability Test Report</h3>
            <h4>Test Report Introduction:</h4>
            <p>
              This report outlines findings from the usability testing conducted
              for Soulace. The goal of the test was to evaluate the app’s key
              features, assess its overall usability, and gather feedback from
              participants. By analyzing their experiences, we aim to identify
              areas for improvement and ensure that Soulace provides meaningful
              support during difficult times. Below are 5 main issues we came
              across and the solutions we implemented.
            </p>
            <h4>Issue #1: Font and Icon size / spacing (High)</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Suggested change: Increase font sizes throughout the app and add
                more spacing between icons in the search results to reduce the
                likelihood of “fat-finger errors”.
              </li>
              <li>
                Evidence: While most participants were able to click the icons
                accurately, it was noticeable that they had to focus more
                carefully to ensure they selected the correct one, both visually
                and physically.
              </li>

            <h4>Issue #2: Layout and Organization (Medium)</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Suggested change: Adjust the layout of the Resources and Support
                pages, as some participants found it unclear which content
                belonged on each page.
              </li>
              <li>
                Evidence: When asked about navigating grief-related information,
                participants expressed confusion about distinguishing content
                between the Resources and Support pages. One participant
                suggested moving the “Community Support” section to the top of
                the Support page for better visibility and hierarchy.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Issue #3: Featured Collections section consistency (High)</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Suggested change: Clarify this section to ensure users
                understand that its content remains consistent across all
                screens..
              </li>
              <li>
                Evidence: While participants grasped the general purpose of the
                section, some assumed its contents were specific to the screen
                they were viewing. For example, they believed the articles
                displayed on the home screen differed from those in the same
                section on the Resources screen, though the content is actually
                identical.

            <h4>Issue #4: Prototype Functionality (High)</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Suggested change: Increase the functional accuracy of prototypes
                in key areas.
              </li>
              <li>
                Evidence: Participants attempted to scroll and interact with
                buttons that were not clickable, leading to some confusion.
                While prototypes don’t need to be fully functional, making
                interactive elements more responsive in test-specific areas
                would improve the testing experience and provide more accurate
                user feedback.

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            In conclusion, creating Soulace has been a meaningful journey. An
            idea rooted from a personal experience, the inspiration to create
            Soulace came from a genuine desire to offer meaningful support to
            those navigating the challenge of loss. The mission was to craft a
            supportive, empathetic space where individuals navigating loss could
            find comfort, clarity and strength.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a time when burdens feel overwhelming, Soulace stands as a tool
            to ease responsibilities, reduce stress and provide a sense of
            solace. The importance of this work lies in its ability to transform
            a difficult experience into one that feels guided, supported and a
            little less isolating. Soulace is more than an app, its a companion
            for the healing journey we all will experience at some point during
            our lifetime.
