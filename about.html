              <h3>
                <span class="emphasis">
                  Once lost, now found in design, an Empathetic Designer
                  creating experiences that truly resonate.
                </span>
              </h3>
              <p>
                I was born on a small island called Saipan (12.5 miles long and
                5.5 miles wide) I know...tiny. Eventually, I moved to Las Vegas,
                where I spent most of my life. My path to design wasn't linear;
                in fact, it was anything but traditional.
              </p>
              <p>
                I once aspired to be a Crime Scene Investigator. Instead, I
                spent over 5 years working in customer service across the food
                and retail industries, with my last role as a Visual Stylist.
                That position became a turning point, I discovered a passion for
                design and was filled with ideas on how to create better
                experiences for people. However, I lacked the technical skills
                to bring those ideas to life.
              </p>
              <p>
                To bridge that gap, I completed a Full Stack Development
                bootcamp, but it wasn't until I discovered UX Design that
                everything clicked. Initially, I tried the self taught route,
                but as I navigated my own learning style, I realized I needed
                structure to stay on track. Enrolling in a UX Program provided
                me with the foundation and focus I needed to grow.
              </p>
              <p>
                Looking back, I once believed I was lost, jumping from one
                career aspiration to another, unable to find my true calling.
                But in reality, there was always a common thread..service.
                Whether it was CSI, where I sought justice for others, customer
                service, where I aimed to make people's experiences better, or
                now UX Design where I create intuitive solutions to improve
                lives, I was always drawn to helping people.
              </p>
              <p>
                Every step of my journey has shaped me into a more empathetic
                designer. My diverse experiences have given me a deeper
                understanding of people from all walks of life, allowing me to
                craft meaningful, human-centered solutions.
              </p>
              <p>
                What once felt like uncertainty was, in truth, the path that
                prepared me for exactly where I'm meant to be today.
